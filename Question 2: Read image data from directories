## Question 2: Read image data from directories-----------##

When training deep learning models, the image data is usually stored in the computer disk. 
We need to load images from computer disk for training deep leanring model.

We usually see similar sample code below:

datagen=ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
train_generator=datagen.flow_from_directory(
        train_dir,
        target_size=(img_width,img_height),
        batch_size=batch_size,
        class_mode='binary',
        shuffle=False
    )

Now we may have questions: 

1) what is the return object 'train_generator'???

Answer: according to the keras source code, we can get:

'train_generator' is a 'DirectoryIterator' yielding tuples of '(x,y)'
where x is is a numpy array containing a batch of images with shape (batch_size,*target_size, channels)
      y is a numpy array of corredponding labels
