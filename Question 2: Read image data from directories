## Question 2: Read image data from directories-----------##

When training deep learning models, the image data is usually stored in the computer disk. 
We need to load images from computer disk for training deep leanring model.

We usually see similar sample code below:

datagen=ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
train_generator=datagen.flow_from_directory(
        train_dir,
        target_size=(img_width,img_height),
        batch_size=batch_size,
        class_mode='binary',
        shuffle=False
    )
